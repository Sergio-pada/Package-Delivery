## Introduction

The Package Delivery System simulates the delivery process of packages using trucks and a hash table to efficiently manage and track packages. It includes features such as package lookup, real-time package status, and distance calculation.

## Setup

1. Install Python.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Download the necessary CSV files: `distances.csv`, `packages.csv`, and `addresses.csv`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the program by executing `python main.py`.

## Usage

The program provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the package delivery system.

- Option 1: Lookup an individual package using its package ID.
- Option 2: Get the delivery status of all packages at a given time.
- Option 3: Exit the program.

Follow the prompts to use the desired options and input information.

## Features

- Efficient package management using hash tables.
- Sorting of packages based on delivery distance.
- Calculation of package delivery times and distances.
- Real-time tracking of package delivery status.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
